1) Put all and ONLY .mp4 files of a SINGLE play which are needed to be parsed
raw masterscript (with .txt suffix)
preParser.py
postParser.py
processor.sh
in the same folder (therefore one folder for each play)
Do NOT put any other .txt, .mp4 and .json files in that folder
2) Start gentle app
3) Open terminal
4) cd to the folder
5) type and run ./processor.sh localhost:8765
this will initiate parsing process for all the .mp4 files in the folder
and will take a while
6) for another play repeat from step 1. It's possible to run process for several plays at once but I wouldn't recommend running more than 2 or 3 at once since all of them are gonna be using the same gentle instance
